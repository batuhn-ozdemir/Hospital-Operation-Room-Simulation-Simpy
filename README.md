# Modelling and Simulation Course Project

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Modelling and Simulation course. The primary objective is to simulate and analyze a discrete-event system to understand its behavior under various constraints. The project involves modeling the system's dynamics, implementing a visual simulation to observe the process flow in real-time, and conducting statistical analysis based on queue lengths and server utilization. Through this simulation, we aim to identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.

## Simulation Details & Visuals

### 1. Statistical Analysis: Queue and Busy Tables

*This image displays the statistical output of the simulation. It includes detailed tables showing the "Queue" status (e.g., average waiting times, maximum queue length) and "Busy" status (server utilization rates) generated during the simulation run. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the modeled system.*

### 2. Visual Simulation Environment
